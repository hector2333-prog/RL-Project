## 📖 Introduction

Welcome to our repository for the **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** project. This project explores the training of intelligent agents capable of playing Atari games from raw pixel inputs. We implement algorithms from scratch as well as leverage state-of-the-art libraries like **Stable Baselines 3**.

The project focuses on two main environments from the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**:
*   **Pong** (Single & Multi-agent)
*   **AirRaid** (Complex Environment)
